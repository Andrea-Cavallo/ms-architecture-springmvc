#How to Run the Application
Prerequisites
Java 11 or higher
Maven
MongoDB


git clone https://github.com/Andrea-Cavallo/ms-architecture-springmvc.git
cd online-marketplace-platform

Start the MongoDB instance.
mongod

Start the Service-Registry (Eureka).
bash

cd service-registry
mvn spring-boot:run
Start the Config-Server.

cd config-server
mvn spring-boot:run

Start the remaining microservices (Order-Service, Payment-Service, Product-Service, and User-Service).
cd order-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd payment-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd product-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run

Finally, start the Api-Cloud-Gateway.

cd api-cloud-gateway
mvn spring-boot:run
The application is now running, and you can access the API endpoints through the Api-Cloud-Gateway at http://localhost:8080.
