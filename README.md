# CIRCUITBREAKER
Reliability Patterns

Circuit breaker â€” A circuit breaker can be used to protect cross-service calls. 
When a certain number of downstream resource requests fail to meet a certain threshold, a circuit breaker opens. The system will quickly fail if the circuit breaker is open. A
fter some time, the client will send some requests to check whether the downstream service has been restored. The request will be sent again once the health is restored if there is a normal response.
